Data-Alchemy has two supported ways to get started with.

## Method 1: Model File (via Roblox Studio)
* Download the `rbxm` model file attached with the latest release from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/Reapimus/data-alchemy/releases)
* Import the model file into Studio into a location like `ReplicatedStorage`

## Method 2: Filesystem
* Copy the `src` directory into your codebase
* Use a plugin like [Rojo](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/rojo) to sync the files into your place
